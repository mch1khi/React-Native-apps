There a two stores selling organic food (and vegan groceries) within 5-10 minutes walk. For the visual hunger there are two art galleries down the streets and in the neighbours building.

As this is our home, from time to time we might have guests over for a drink, dinner or film projection in the apartment (you are welcome to join us of course:) ), or, not so often but sometimes, we could have a friend that needs to sleep on our sofa for a night or two. Our flat is pretty large, we always try to be considerate of our Airbnb guests' comfort, peace and privacy, so we will try our best to not have anything affect your stay here negatively - we are happy to haven't had problems with anyone so far!", "house_rules": "We are non-smokers, so please keep in mind that smoking is allowed only on the balcony, where you can also sit and enjoy your morning coffee :) Also important: file sharing and downloading through torrent/file-sharing software is  strictly illegal in Germany and results in hefty fines, so please don't do it!

I am happy to share my own place through the cumminuty, together with my friend Dalma. We are looking forward to welcome you and provide you with a great and comfortable stay in West-Berlin, in one of the nicest residential areas of the city in the 'Bayerischen-Viertel' (Bayern-Distric). This area is rich in parks and in pre-war architecture, and shows a more traditional look of the Berlin as it was before the second world war. Yet it is all very close to the modern city life of Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, Zoo, Tiergarten, Nollendorfplatz, Potsdamer Platz and to all the vibrant metropolis features that the city has become to offer.  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nAbout me:\r\n I don't have pets and I do not smoke. I prefer quiet evenings with a good movie, self made healthy food, listening to the the daily news, and some educative documentaries with a glass of good wine.

We are in our thirties and work every day during the week and travel or dj and party on the weekend. We dj and produce electronic music (slow techno, acid, post disco, chug), have a blog and run our own events. \r\n\r\nWe love traveling, music, films, art, parties and meeting new interesting people. \r\n\r\nWe enjoy having friends over at ours and are smokers.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to Berlin!

We will be staying a few nights under the same roof, so it would be good if we more or less got along.\r\n\r\n We would also prefer to have guests who will not be cooking at home (had the forgotten hot plate/stove or burnt pans and smell all over the house way too many times so far. It's not really worth the risk, since our own flat/things are at stake, so we prefer to be careful than sorry). You can of course keep things in the fridge, just no cooking please. Eating out in Berlin is very cheap anyways and we are happy to give you tips.\r\n\r\nWe also have the rule of no shoes in the house, you would have to leave them in the flat by the entrance. \r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to bring people back to the flat.

I speak English, German, Italian, Spanish and Greek.\r\n\r\nI live in Friedrichshain, Berlin with my husband Max, who is working as a product manager at two music labels. We are in our thirties and work every day during the week and travel or dj and party on the weekend. We dj and produce electronic music (slow techno, acid, post disco, chug), have a blog and run our own events. \r\n\r\nWe love traveling, music, films, art, parties and meeting new interesting people. \r\n\r\nWe enjoy having friends over at ours and are smokers.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to Berlin!

We will be staying a few nights under the same roof, so it would be good if we more or less got along.\r\n\r\n We would also prefer to have guests who will not be cooking at home (had the forgotten hot plate/stove or burnt pans and smell all over the house way too many times so far. It's not really worth the risk, since our own flat/things are at stake, so we prefer to be careful than sorry). You can of course keep things in the fridge, just no cooking please. Eating out in Berlin is very cheap anyways and we are happy to give you tips.\r\n\r\nWe also have the rule of no shoes in the house, you would have to leave them in the flat by the entrance. \r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to bring people back to the flat.

As I will be travelling, you guys will stay in my room during your reservation period. The room is spacious and bright with sprinkles of sun coming through during the mid-morning time. There is a proper bed for 2 to sleep in. Additionally, you have a self-made and cozy couch to mingle on after a long day. And if you feel like you also can watch TV. Since the room is part of a flat share the bathroom and kitchen are areas which have to be shared with either me or my room mate.

Which was also the beginning of my travel addiction and longing for more of getting to know different cultures. \r\nBesides travelling, I love to do various sports starting from kickboxing to table tennis over to football. Though at the moment I am focussing rather on kickboxing. During the rest of my freetime, I love to hang around with friends and discover new places in my city, as well as going to the movies and reading.\r\n\r\nMy motto in life: Respect every single person and treat them as you want to be treated yourself.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to stay with you. \r\nBest regs, Chantal", "host_response_time": "within a day", "host_response_rate": 90, "host_acceptance_rate": null, "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7612325/profile_pic/1414162367/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small", "host_picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7612325/profile_pic/1414162367/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium", "host_neighbourhood": "Sch\u00f6neberg", "host_listings_count": 1, "host_total_listings_count": 1, "host_verifications": ["email", "phone", "reviews", "jumio"], "street": "Sch\u00f6neberg, Berlin, Berlin 10827, Germany", "neighbourhood": "Sch\u00f6neberg", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Sch\u00f6neberg-S\u00fcd", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": "Tempelhof - Sch\u00f6neberg", "city": "Berlin", "state": "Berlin", "zipcode": "10827", "market": "Berlin", "smart_location": "Berlin, Germany", "country_code": "DE", "country": "Germany", "latitude": "52.478982792118856", "longitude": "13.348372994659808", "property_type": "Apartment", "room_type": "Private room", "accommodates": 3, "bathrooms": 1.0, "bedrooms": 1, "beds": 1, "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": ["TV", "Cable TV", "Internet", "Wireless Internet", "Kitchen", "Heating", "First aid kit", "Safety card", "Essentials", "Hair dryer", "Laptop friendly workspace", "Bathtub"], "square_feet": null, "price": 38, "weekly_price": null, "monthly_price": null, "security_deposit": null, "cleaning_fee": 5, "guests_included": 1, "extra_people": 0, "minimum_nights": 2, "maximum_nights": 1125, "calendar_updated": "4 days ago", "has_availability": null, "availability_30": 0, "availability_60": 4, "availability_90": 4, "availability_365": 4, "calendar_last_scraped": "2017-05-08", "number_of_reviews": 10, "first_review": "2014-08-04", "last_review": "2017-04-18", "review_scores_rating": 100, "review_scores_accuracy": 10, "review_scores_cleanliness": 10, "review_scores_checkin": 9, "review_scores_communication": 10, "review_scores_location": 10, "review_scores_value": 10, "license": null, "jurisdiction_names": null, "cancellation_policy": "moderate", "calculated_host_listings_count": 1, "reviews_per_month": 0.3, "geolocation": {"lon": 13.348372994659808, "lat": 52.478982792118856}, "features": ["Host Has Profile Pic", "Host Identity Verified", "Is Location Exact"]},{"id": "15017353", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15017353", "scrape_id": "20170507222235", "last_scraped": "2017-05-08", "name": "Sch\u00f6n, Sch\u00f6ner, Sch\u00f6neberg:Grosser Balkon und Park", "summary": "Die Unterkunft ist in der 5 Gehminuten vom Winterfeldplatz entfernt.

Tats\u00e4chlich hat Neuk\u00f6lln mit seiner erwachenden Kulturszene besonders jungen Berlin-Touristen einiges zu bieten. Schon seit 1999 gibt es zum Beispiel beim Festival 48 Stunden Neuk\u00f6lln ein Wochenende lang Theater, Lesungen und mehr zu sehen. Rund um den Reuterkiez ist eine lebendige Clubszene gewachsen und selbst in weiter entfernten Nebenstra\u00dfen \u00f6ffnen kleine Galerien und Kneipen. Besonders in Nord-Neuk\u00f6lln, an der Grenze zu Kreuzberg zwischen Landwehrkanal und Sonnenallee, hat sich der Bezirk in den vergangenen drei Jahren gewandelt. Kreuzk\u00f6lln nennen deshalb manche Berliner die Gegend, eine Art Hybrid-Kiez also. Und mittendrin: die Weserstra\u00dfe. Dort reiht sich heute eine Kneipe an die n\u00e4chste. Die G\u00e4ste sind junge Hauptstadttouristen, Backpacker und Studenten. Sie suchen in Neuk\u00f6lln das, was sie von Berlin erwarten: eine l\u00e4ssige Abgeranztheit, neue Musik,", "notes": "Die Wohnung befindet sich im Dachgeschoss.
